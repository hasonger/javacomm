ExNFR - 

_
The following documents not found in UCM for which it ask to refer.
  # Secure Application Deployment Guideline [document# CNK-IT-APPSEC-001]
  # Application Security Applicaiton Qualification Request [Document# CNK-IT-APPSEC-002]
_


==Application Security (pg 9)==
1. OWASP Top Ten Compliance - 
     In document it is mentioned to visit the third party system [OWASP] by clicking a URL.
_
  * It should not point to any URL on third party system for the requirement those are specific to the organization/application. The requirements must be specified in the document.
  * The third party system can be included as a reference.
_

2. Application Security Qualification Request
     Application vendor must provide dully security architecture template.....
_
  * It needs more clarification, whether NTL will have to do it?
  * Suggestion: refer third party tools like firebug etc those are having expertise in application security area.
_


3. *Application security feature related with Operating systems must be referred to CnK infra team, not with application.*

==Recoverability/ Disaster Recovery/Restorability/Resilience==
1. Application Self-Resiliency
    Restoration should be on multiple databases.
    Application MUST support mysql 5, Microsoft Sql Server 8 and Oracle 11g and above.
_
  * As of now we are only targeting Oracle Database. Need to check it again.
_

2. Multiple Commits Feature
_
  * It is two phase commit feature and DB must support distributed transaction management.
_

3. Out of Sync Protection
_
  * It is a clustering feature. 
  * Also assumption is, multiple databases will be from same vendor and probably same version.
_

4. Load Balancing
_
  * Load balancer would involve in balancing the web server and applications. It would be part of IT infra team. 
  * We need to look for codes to be supported in clustering like session attributes.
_

==Usability and Application Portability==

1. Install ability
      Installation on multiple platforms:
  * Travel ERP is a java/J2EE based application. Portability is an inherent feature of java.

2. Browser Support and HTML support
     _Here there is contradictory statements. _
  "Application should support IE7+, Opera11+, Mozilla Firefox 11+, Google Chrome (RC), Safari 4+"

  AND

  "HTML5 and above should be used."

_
We know some enlisted browser does not support HTML5. The application compliant with HTML5 will not run in many of browsers mentioned in the list like IE7.
_

3. Minimal Java Script Usage

_
Scope is not clear. Everything on HTML page is a content. It should be defined like which type of content would not be handled using JS.
_


==Performance and Administration==
1. Captive Performance Load Management System
   “The application will have ability to track & act upon defined performance parameters........”

_
It is an overhead to the Travel ERP application. An adequete design must be in place.
_

2. Self Backup
“The application will have the ability to fire /executes its own backup. and .....”

_
It is an overhead to the Travel ERP application. An adequete design must be in place.
_



Also the document talk more about security and administration where IT infra involvement is more important than NFR those are relevant to the application.
