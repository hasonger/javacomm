Dear Sir/Madam,

With reference to attached inland letter, we are pleased that our builder i.e. Bhoomi Hills Developer is a customer of your branch and hence we would like to mention our concerns in this regard against builder.

We would like to admit you that many pending formalities/works/activities are still pending from the builder i.e. Bhoomi Hills Developer even though society has been formed since April, 2010 where Bhoomi Hills Developer was only the promoter in forming the society. Afterwards we have not received any cooperation/support from the builder. 

We just like mention you that pending works/formalities like Construction of Club House, Providing Occupation Certificates, Conveyance Deed, handover of accounts etc are not yet executed.

We request you to provide details of all accounts those come under Bhoomi Hills Developer.
We further request you to kindly not allow the builder to withdraw money without our consent. Because the money belongs to these accounts are to be used Bhoomi Hill Building mentioned pending works.

Thanks for your cooperation,
