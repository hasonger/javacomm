Milestone Release
         Two types of Milestones
                   Minor Release - Testing of Sub features 
                   Major Release  - A complete cycle Release
          A milestone release will be moved from development to testing environment on demand basis i.e. whenever development team feels a stable build, it would be promoted to testing environment.
          For on Demand Basis, an approval is required. Sprint Owner (Cluster Owner) has to approve the build to perform the release [move to next environment]. 
          A milestone release would be the Last Daily Build artefact [there will be no build in milestone ]
          Every release would be tagged [scm:tag].
          Every release would be release to maven repository [Nexus].
