Review comments on White Label - Template Master(CKIL_056103) Use Case

1. As per use case in Add screen Template Id would be pre populated and read only. According to me it would 
    be auto generated. 

2. There is facility to Activate/Deactivate Template Master, is approval workflow applicable for the same.

3. If there is no approval workflow applicable for this use case then default value for status should be Activated   
    not Deactivated.

4. Validation rule is missing for field attributes.
